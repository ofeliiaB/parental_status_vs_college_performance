# RKC Students' Data Analysis
<br>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>The findings argue that females as well as females with kids show academically strong performance, but they are underrepresented at the college as well as in the data-related fields.</p>
<br>
<h2>Project Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of the project is to study the gender gap of students at RKC in relation to their academic performance and interest in working with data. The audience can use the outcomes of the analysis to better understand whether a certain student group is underperforming and start further research into the causes of the phenomena and ways to improve program delivery processes at the college to meet the needs of various groups. Moreover, using the performance difference RKC can attract different groups to study Masterâ€™s programs, as well as find out whether females need extra motivation to get interested in data-related fields.</p>
